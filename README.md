# Work-day-scheduler

## User story:

* As a developer, I want to create a daily planner that meets certain criteria, so that I can create an organized time-block schedule. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* It's done when I scroll down and I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9:00am-5:00pm). 

* It's done when each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

* It's done when I can click into a time block and enter an event, and I am able to save the event for that time block.

*It's done when I refresh the page and the events persist.
